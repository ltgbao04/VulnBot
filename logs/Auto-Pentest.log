2025-03-07 15:36:12.443 | INFO     | actions.plan_summary:get_summary:28 - summary: **Penetration Testing Process Summary**

The penetration testing process was conducted with the target IP address identified as **123.45.67.89**, ensuring comprehensive coverage of potential vulnerabilities. Access logs were collected to monitor the execution of the application, identifying unauthorized actions and system interactions.

A manual rootkit and patch injection strategy was implemented using known vulnerabilities in the application's codebase. This involved creating a modified version of the target code, which was then patched with known vulnerabilities. The process confirmed that critical security patches were identified, highlighting areas requiring immediate attention.

Automated tools such as OWASP Zero-day toolchain were utilized for automated scanning to test various attack vectors and identify new vulnerabilities. Results from automated scans showed vulnerabilities in specific components or functions of the application, reinforcing the need for manual testing.

A vulnerability assessment was conducted using threat modeling techniques, identifying vulnerabilities based on their severity relative to the threat level. This step ensured that all identified patches were classified appropriately and prioritized accordingly.

Penetration test results were thoroughly reviewed, providing insights into potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities. The findings were used to update the application's security configuration, ensuring compliance with current security best practices.

Finally, the application was updated to reflect any newly discovered vulnerabilities or improved security measures. This comprehensive approach ensured that all known threats were mitigated before proceeding with deployment or further penetration testing.
